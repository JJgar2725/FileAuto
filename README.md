# FileAuto - automating files

Hello! This is FileAuto.

This project is a Python automating script that allows for maintaining and cleaning a user's Downloads folder. The script mainly relies off the os and watchdog modules provided by Python. The idea was to continue experimenting with Python automation, and so this is what was able to come from that.

Below details the basic functionality of the program, as well as installation and usage commands.

## **_Installation_**

First clone the Github repository into a safe location and move into the created directory to create the .env file with your Downloads path.

```
git clone "https://github.com/JJgar2725/FileAuto.git"
cd FileAuto
touch .env
```

Inside the .env file, your Downloads folder path should be in the following format:

```
PATH_TO_DOWNLOADS=your path goes here
```
